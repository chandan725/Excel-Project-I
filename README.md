Above link is associated with the raw dataset (Salaries of different Data Science fields in the Data Science domain). The Dataset does contain 11 columns, briefly described below:

1. work_year: The year of joining into the organisation.
2. experience_level: The experience level in the job during the year.
3. employment_type: The type of employment for the role.
4. job_title: The role worked in during the year.
5. salary: The total gross salary amount paid.
6. salary_currency: The currency of the salary paid.
7. salaryinusd: The salary in USD.
8. employee_residence: Employee's primary country of residence in during the work year as an ISO 3166 country code.
9. remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely
10. company_location: The country of the employer's main office or contracting branch
11. company_size: The median number of people that worked for the company during the year

The above dashboard does compare the salary (in terms of average salary) of different Data Science fields based on the parameters like: company location, company size, joining year, employment type, experience level & remote ratio of company.

## Project Overview
The Excel project is designed to enhance data analysis workflows by leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft Excel. It provides a set of templates, formulas to perform various data-related tasks, including data cleaning, pivots & visualization, and reporting.
## Features
__Data cleaning and preprocessing:__ Utilize built-in Excel functions and formulas to cleanse and transform raw data for analysis purposes.

___Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel typically involve several steps to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis. Here are the general steps for data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel:___

__1. Import the data:__ Load the raw data into an Excel worksheet. This can be done by copying and pasting the data directly or using Excel's data import features, such as opening a CSV or text file or connecting to a database.

__2. Remove duplicate records:__ Identify and eliminate any duplicate rows or records in the dataset. Excel provides a built-in "Remove Duplicates" feature under the "Data" tab that allows you to specify which columns to consider for identifying duplicates.

__3. Handle missing values:__ Identify and handle any missing or blank values in the dataset. You can use Excel functions such as IF, ISBLANK, or COUNTBLANK to identify missing values and choose an appropriate strategy to handle them, such as removing rows with missing values, replacing them with averages or zeros, or interpolating values.

__4. Correct data inconsistencies:__ Check for any inconsistencies or errors in the data, such as inconsistent formatting, misspellings, or inconsistent naming conventions. Excel's functions like TRIM, PROPER, UPPER, and LOWER can help clean up text data. 

__5. Standardize data formats:__ Ensure that data is in a consistent format throughout the dataset. For example, you may want to convert date and time values to a standard format, change numeric values to a consistent number format, or convert text to a specific case (uppercase or lowercase).

__6. Filter and remove outliers:__ Identify and handle any outliers or extreme values in the dataset. Excel's filtering capabilities, such as sorting the data or using the "Filter" option under the "Data" tab, can help identify and remove outliers or apply specific treatments to them based on the nature of the data.

__7. Validate data integrity:__ Perform data validation checks to ensure the data conforms to predefined rules or constraints. Excel's data validation feature allows you to set criteria and restrictions on data entry, such as specifying valid ranges, data types, or custom formulas.

__8. Transform and aggregate data:__ If needed, transform and aggregate the data to match the desired format or level of granularity for analysis. Excel's functions like SUMIF, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, and pivot tables can be used to summarize and aggregate data based on specific criteria or groupings.

__9. Document data cleaning steps:__ It's essential to document the data cleaning steps performed on the dataset. This documentation should outline the specific actions taken, such as the formulas used, filters applied, or any changes made to the original data. This documentation ensures transparency, reproducibility, and facilitates future analysis or data updates.

By following these steps, you can effectively clean and preprocess your data in Excel before proceeding with data analysis and visualization tasks.

__Data visualization:__ Leverage Excel's charting capabilities to create visually appealing and informative charts and graphs.
